# Possible Mappings

- Amplitude -> distance from centre point
- Tempo / density of onsets -> reduce smoothing
- Tempo / density of onsets -> frequency of colour changes

# Data

- Note: Starting position might be irrelevant?
- Each frame is a list of atom_id's in z-axis order
- Each atom contains a list of x, y, z positions in frame order: would allow for easier smoothing
- z-axis relates to order but could also be size / shade of colour e.g. darker if further away
- Loop through frame by frame; loop over atoms in frame, pull the appropriate atom_id, update the current location, transform by mappings, display.
- Can we do multi threading to have ~4 iterators over each frame?
